1. To generate the detection signal, please run 'run.py' and set 'gen_audio' to 1.

2. To estimate the channel impulse response (CIR) of the reflected signal, please run 'run.py' and set 'estimate_audio' to 1.

3. To classify the CIR images using the VGG model, please run 'vgg_model/vgg.py'.

1. 'test.wav' is a file containing a reflected signal that you can use to estimate the CIR.

2. 'vgg_model/CIR' is a directory that includes some sample CIR images.
